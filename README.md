# Questions-repo
I have worked on both monolithic and microservices-based environments.
    
In my first project, I worked mainly on AWS infrastructure automation using Terraform modules. I provisioned services like VPC, EC2, S3, and IAM, and implemented remote backend using S3 and DynamoDB. I also built CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins for Java application deployments and created Docker-based Jenkins agents to maintain a consistent build environment. I assisted in troubleshooting build failures and deployment issues using logs and Bash scripts.
    
In my second project, I supported an AWS EKS platform along with a senior engineer. My responsibilities included validating ingress and TLS configuration, setting up centralized monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, and ensuring workloads were running properly. I also helped troubleshoot issues like pod CrashLoopBackOff, PVC pending states, and storage-related problems.
    
Overall, my experience includes infrastructure automation, CI/CD, Kubernetes monitoring, and production issue troubleshooting. I’m now looking for a role where I can further grow and work more deeply with cloud and DevOps tools in a production environment.”
