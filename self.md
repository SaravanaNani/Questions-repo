Hi My name is saravana , I am Devops engineer with ~ 2 years of hand s on exp in AWS, Jenkins, Terraform and docker and k8s.

In My Perious role at adeaquare info pvt ltd, I  have worked on both monolithic and microservices-based environments.

In my first project, I mainly worked on AWS infrastructure automation using Terraform modules. I provisioned services like VPC, EC2, S3, and IAM, and implemented a remote backend using S3 and DynamoDB for safe state management. I also built CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins for Java application deployments and created Docker-based Jenkins agents to maintain a consistent build environment. I assisted in troubleshooting build and deployment issues using logs and Bash scripts.

In my second project, I supported an AWS EKS platform along with a senior engineer. My responsibilities included validating ingress and TLS configurations, setting up centralized monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki, and ensuring Kubernetes workloads were running properly. I also helped troubleshoot production issues such as pod CrashLoopBackOff, PVC pending states, and storage-related problems.

Overall, my experience covers infrastructure automation, CI/CD pipelines, Kubernetes monitoring, and production troubleshooting. I’m now looking for a role where I can grow further and work more deeply with cloud and DevOps tools in a production environment.

My strengths are strong automation skills, good troubleshooting ability, and a solid understanding of Linux and cloud systems.
One area I’m improving is deep Kubernetes internals, and I actively upskill through hands-on practice and real-time problem solving.
