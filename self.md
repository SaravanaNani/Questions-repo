Hello, my name is Saravana, and I’m a DevOps Engineer with around 2 years of hands-on experience working on cloud infrastructure, CI/CD pipelines, and containerized environments.

In my previous role, I worked extensively on CI/CD pipeline management using Jenkins, where I automated build, test, and deployment processes for Java-based applications. I also created Docker-based Jenkins agents to ensure consistent and reliable build environments. This helped reduce build failures and improved delivery speed.

On the infrastructure side, I’ve used Terraform and Ansible to provision and configure AWS resources such as VPCs, EC2, S3, IAM roles, and security groups. I believe strongly in Infrastructure as Code because it brings consistency, scalability, and auditability to environments.

In my second project, I supported Kubernetes workloads on AWS EKS, where I worked on Dockerized applications, ingress and TLS configuration, and set up monitoring using Prometheus, Grafana, and Loki. I also handled real production issues like pod crashes, PVC pending states, and performance troubleshooting, which taught me how important reliability and observability are in production systems.

My strengths are automation, troubleshooting, and a strong Linux foundation. I’m comfortable writing Bash and Python scripts to automate repetitive tasks. One area I continuously improve is deep Kubernetes internals, and I actively upskill through hands-on labs and real scenarios.

I believe I’m a good fit for this role because I enjoy working closely with developers and QA teams, following DevOps best practices, and building systems that are secure, scalable, and reliable. I’m excited about the opportunity to work from the Bengaluru office, learn from senior engineers, and contribute meaningfully to your engineering team.

Thank you for your time and consideration.
